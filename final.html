          Wishing you a day as special as you are to me. Every moment spent with you is a treasure, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. You light up my world in ways I never knew possible. Baby I feel like we have truly come a long way, 3 years ago on this day was the first time i ever spoke my heart to you and there has not been a day that i regretted it, I love the time we’ve spent and its truly a magical experience being with THE bhairavi! I mean you’re actually a blessing to me and it’s been such a wonderful time with you. Let’s not make this about us but I just want you to know I’ve been ever longingly thankful for you! Baby you are very perfect and I wish a veryyyyy happy birthday again just in case I haven’t enough times, you are very special to me and always will be. Bhairavi thank you for existing because there’s always something magical about you. I will never know what it is but like I fell you carry a certain charm that nobody has the butterflies I feel when I see you and when I’m around you are just something I can’t put into words, it’s truly magical. You, are magical. Baby please never stop being yourself because you’re the best as you are. Ik I tell you this like pretty much every year but ehhhh I just think you shouldn’t change for anyone. I’d love like a little bit understanding added but you’re perfect the way you are! Babe I won’t ramble on more since you’ve got a whole day for yours to enjoy! The Bhairavi day! Here's to many more birthdays, memories, and endless love. I love you!
